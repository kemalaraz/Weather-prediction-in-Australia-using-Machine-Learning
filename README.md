# Weather-prediction-in-Australia-via-Machine-Learning

This repository focusses on the rain prediction over Australia. The dataset was gathered from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package). <br>
The features of the dataset introduced below: <br>
**Date:** The date of observation <br>
**Location:** The common name of the location of the weather station <br>
**MinTemp:** The minimum temperature in degrees celsius <br>
**MaxTemp:** The maximum temperature in degrees celsius <br>
**Rainfall:** The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm <br>
**Evaporation:** The so-called Class A pan evaporation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am <br>
**Sunshine:** The number of hours of bright sunshine in the day <br>
**WindGustDir:** The direction of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight <br>
**WindGustSpeed:** The speed (km/h) of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight <br>
**WindDir9am:** Direction of the wind at 9am <br>
**WindDir3pm:** Direction of the wind at 3pm <br>
**WindSpeed9am:** Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 9am <br>
**WindSpeed3pm:** Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 3pm <br>
**Humidity9am:** Humidity (percent) at 9am <br>
**Humidity3pm:** Humidity (percent) at 3pm <br>
**Pressure9am:** Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 9am <br>
**Pressure3pm:** Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 3pm <br>
**Cloud9am:** Fraction of sky obscured by cloud at 9am. This is measured in "oktas", which are a unit of eigths. It records how many eigths of the sky are obscured by cloud. A 0 measure indicates completely clear sky whilst an 8 indicates that it is completely overcast <br>
**Cloud3pm:** Fraction of sky obscured by cloud (in "oktas": eighths) at 3pm. See Cload9am for a description of the values <br>
**Temp9am:** Temperature (degrees C) at 9am <br>
**Temp3pm:** Temperature (degrees C) at 3pm <br>
**RainTodayBoolean:** 1 if precipitation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am exceeds 1mm, otherwise 0 <br>
**RISK_MM:** The amount of next day rain in mm. Used to create response variable RainTomorrow. A kind of measure of the "risk" <br>
**RainTomorrow:** The target variable. Did it rain tomorrow? <br>
